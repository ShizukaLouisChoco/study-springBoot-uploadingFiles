Uploading Files
This guide walks you through the process of creating a server application that can receive HTTP multi-part file uploads.

What You Will Build
You will create a Spring Boot web application that accepts file uploads. You will also build a simple HTML interface to upload a test file.

Initial dependencies:
Spring Web, Thymeleaf

1) Create an Application Class
    To start a Spring Boot MVC application, you first need a starter. In this sample, spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf and spring-boot-starter-web are already added as dependencies.
    To upload files with Servlet containers, you need to register a MultipartConfigElement class (which would be <multipart-config> in web.xml).
    Thanks to Spring Boot, everything is auto-configured for you!

    All you need to get started with this application is the following UploadingFilesApplication class (from src/main/java/com/example/uploadingfiles/UploadingFilesApplication.java):

    As part of auto-configuring Spring MVC, Spring Boot will create a MultipartConfigElement bean and make itself ready for file uploads.

2) Create a File Upload Controller
   The initial application already contains a few classes to deal with storing and loading the uploaded files on disk. They are all located in the com.example.uploadingfiles.storage package. You will use those in your new FileUploadController. The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/uploadingfiles/FileUploadController.java) shows the file upload controller:

   The FileUploadController class is annotated with @Controller so that Spring MVC can pick it up and look for routes.
   Each method is tagged with @GetMapping or @PostMapping to tie the path and the HTTP action to a particular controller action.
   In this case:
   GET /: Looks up the current list of uploaded files from the StorageService and loads it into a Thymeleaf template. It calculates a link to the actual resource by using MvcUriComponentsBuilder.

   GET /files/{filename}: Loads the resource (if it exists) and sends it to the browser to download by using a Content-Disposition response header.

   POST /: Handles a multi-part message file and gives it to the StorageService for saving.

   *In a production scenario, you more likely would store the files in a temporary location, a database, or perhaps a NoSQL store (such as Mongoâ€™s GridFS).
   It is best to NOT load up the file system of your application with content.

   You will need to provide a StorageService so that the controller can interact with a storage layer (such as a file system).
   The following listing (from src/main/java/com/example/uploadingfiles/storage/StorageService.java) shows that interface:

3) Creating an HTML Template
   The following Thymeleaf template (from src/main/resources/templates/uploadForm.html) shows an example of how to upload files and show what has been uploaded:
   This template has three parts:
   1) An optional message at the top where Spring MVC writes a flash-scoped message.
   2) A form that lets the user upload files.
   3) A list of files supplied from the backend.

4) Tuning File Upload Limits
   When configuring file uploads, it is often useful to set limits on the size of files.
   Imagine trying to handle a 5GB file upload!
   With Spring Boot, we can tune its auto-configured MultipartConfigElement with some property settings.
   Add the following properties to your existing properties settings (in src/main/resources/application.properties):

    The multipart settings are constrained as follows:
   spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=128KB
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size is set to 128KB, meaning total file size cannot exceed 128KB.
   spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size=128KB
    spring.servlet.multipart.max-request-size is set to 128KB, meaning total request size for a multipart/form-data cannot exceed 128KB.
